OK, I just tried it on Linux myself. The mprotect thing didn't work by itself, but this does:
    mprotect(addr, len, PROT_NONE);
    madvise(addr, len, MADV_DONTNEED);

I'm not sure about Mac.
>>>
Hmm, I realized I may have been wrong here, Paul. In theory, if you do this:
  mprotect(addr, len, PROT_NONE);
  mprotect(addr, len, PROT_READ);
then the data stored at addr should still be accessible. That means that the OS is not allowed to throw the page away. It's possible that on MacOS, it's just being paged out to disk, which is not what we want.

On Linux, the madvise(DONTNEED) call actually causes the page to be thrown away. I wonder if it has the same effect on the Mac. One way to test this is as follows:
  memset(addr, 0x37, len);
  mprotect(addr, len, PROT_NONE);
  mprotect(addr, len, PROT_READ);
  printf("%x\n", *addr);
If you get 0x37, then it was just paged out and not thrown away. In Linux, adding the DONTNEED call between the mprotect calls causes you to get 0.

Also, it turns out you don't even need mprotect on Linux. The madvise is sufficient.

This doesn't work on Mac. However, I tested the mmap call from comment 3, and that _does_ decommit, so I think we have a winner there. I'm going to experiment on doing that for jemalloc, and watch whether Tp5 drops. That will definitely confirm it.
>>>


Other (linux+android I guess):


                madvise((void *)((uintptr_t)chunk + (i <<
                    pagesize_2pow)), (npages << pagesize_2pow),
                    MADV_FREE);

    if (mmap(addr, size, PROT_NONE, MAP_FIXED | MAP_PRIVATE | MAP_ANON, -1,
        0) == MAP_FAILED)
        abort();

1. On Linux/Mac, there's no explicit commit step.  Memory freed with MADV_DONTNEED (Linux) or MADV_FREE (Mac) doesn't need to be explicitly re-madvise'd before it's touched.  When you modify an MADV_DONTNEED'ed page, you incur a page fault which gives you a physical page there.

2. jemalloc keeps around some amount (a few mb) of committed but unused memory.  (This is reported in about:memory as heap-dirty.)

3. When jemalloc decommits, it decommits adjacent pages in a single operation.

>>>
From everything I can see, the new (> 8.1) DiscardVirtualMemory API results in very similar functionality to MEM_RESET - but MEM_RESET is available right back to XP.

For my ref:
"
nt!MiResetVirtualMemory is the kernel workhorse for VirtualAlloc(MEM_RESET). It does
the following:
1) If the page is present - Clears the DIRTY bit in PTE. (Since W2k3 if ACCCESSED bit in PTE is 1, it is cleared and the WSLE age is set to maximum, so this page is marked as a 'good candidate' to be removed from the process' working set next time the trimming happens). The space in page file allocated for this page is marked as free.  Note the page remains in working set.
2) If the page is in transition state - 
- If the page is in standby-list, there is nothing to do.
- If the page is in modified-list, it is moved to standby-list and page file space is freed.
3) Otherwise if page has been swapped out and it in the page file - page file space
is freed.

Read attempt from page that has been "reseted":
If the PTE is in demand-zero state, and you try to read, page fault happens and fresh zeroed page will be returned. If PTE is in transition state, soft-page fault happens, page is moved from the standby list to the process working set, and original content of the page will be read. And finally if PTE is in working set - original content will be read.  Note than in any moment, even in the middle of read, the page content may be taken away from you. That's why we need to write into page in order to "take ownership" of it.

Write attempt to page that has been "reseted":
If page is in the working set - PTE's DIRTY bit will be set by the hardware.
If page is demand-zero - soft page fault, fresh zeroed page is returned. PTE's DIRTY
bit will be set.
If page is in the standby list - soft page fault; page will be moved from the standby list to the working set. PTE's DIRTY bit will be set.  
So a write operation puts page back in "normal" state.
"

DiscardVirtualMemory: "Use this function to discard memory contents that are no longer needed, while keeping the memory region itself committed. Discarding memory may give physical RAM back to the system. When the region of memory is again accessed by the application, the backing RAM is restored, and the contents of the memory is undefined."


>>>


VirtualFree/munmap: removal of the pages from the process' memory mapping.  What we are currently doing is VirtualAlloc(..., MEM_RESET, ...) and mmadvise(..., MADV_DONTNEED, ...) which 
keeps the pages in the process' management, but tells the kernel that the pages are no longer in use.  The effect of this is that if the kernel needs to free up physical memory in the future,
 it will preferentially use these pages and not bother swapping them out before overwriting them.

>>>
The stricter decommit is not needed with MADV_DONTNEED on Linux.  On Linux, MADV_DONTNEED'ed pages don't count against your RSS.  
It is needed with MADV_FREE'd pages on Mac.  I don't know about Windows; we should test...

// Linux and Android provide MADV_REMOVE which is preferred as it has a
